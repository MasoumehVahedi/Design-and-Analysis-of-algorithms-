In this repository, I implemented some important algorithms, including:

### Greedy algorithms

#### 1- Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a Shortest Path Algorithm. Given a weighted, directed graph, and a starting vertex, it returns the shortest distance from the starting (source) vertex to every vertex in the graph.

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm in many applications where it is crucial to find the shortest path between two points.
