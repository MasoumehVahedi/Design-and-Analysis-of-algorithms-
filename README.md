In this repository, I implemented some important algorithms, including:

### Greedy algorithms

#### 1- Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is a greedy algorithm which all edges of a graph are sorted in increasing order. After that, new edges and nodes are added provided that there is no forming a cycle in MST. Each edge is selected based on their minimum weighted. As a result, it chooses an optimal solution locally at each step. 


#### 2- Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a Shortest Path Algorithm. Given a weighted, directed graph, and a starting vertex, it returns the shortest distance from the starting (source) vertex to every vertex in the graph.

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm in many applications where it is crucial to find the shortest path between two points.
